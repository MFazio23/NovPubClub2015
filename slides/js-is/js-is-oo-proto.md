#Javascript is...
##object-oriented and prototype-based
Note:
+ Everything in JS is an object except _string_, _numeric_, and _boolean_ primitives
    + Even the primitives have object wrappers
+ Prototype-based, not class based
    + Existing objects are cloned to create new ones
+ Allow and encourage alteration of prototypes at run-time
+ All instances of an object share default (prototype) properties
