#Javascript is...
> a high-level, dynamic, interpreted, and untyped language.

Note:
+ High-level: No need to mess with the computer's systems, like registers or memory addresses.
+ Dynamic: Modify object structures/definitions and type system at runtime.
+ Interpreted: Code is executed directly without being compiled.
+ Untyped: Really means "dynamically typed", which means variable type is only checked at runtime.
    + Everything is declared as _var_.
    + One variable can have multiple types assigned to it in one lifetime.
